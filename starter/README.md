# Exercise: Writing Your First Utility Classes

The purpose of this exercise to create your first utility classes that you will ship with your component library.

You will implement 4 different utility classes:

- `odyssey-stack`
- `odyssey-background`
- `odyssey-scrollbars`
- `odyssey-button`

Once you're development server is running, open up your browser to see the UI you'll be working with.

You can also see the markdown inside of the `index.html` file.

To complete the exercise, you'll need to edit the `./style.css` file. The code is already annotated, so it should be clear where you need to add your code.

## Task 1: `.odyssey-stack`

Create a utility class that renders the children of the selector in a stack.

## Task 2 `.odyssey-background`

Create a utility class that displays the `cd-background.svg` image as the background of the element.

## Task 3 `.odyssey-scrollbars`

Create a utility class that updates the default scrollbars to display custom styles.

## Task 4 `.odyssey-button`

Create a utility class that displays a button with the correct styles. You'll need to also complete the CSS rules for the variants, like `data-size="small"`, `data-color="red"` and `:active` state
